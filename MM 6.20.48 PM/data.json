        "As a Senior Postdoctoral Researcher at MIT Senseable City Lab, I lead its Global Labs —Amsterdam, Dubai, Rio— where my work bridges technology, design, and urban science. With a PhD in urban design and data science, I explore how physical, digital, and human interactions shape urban environments.",
        "I lead projects featured in journals like Nature Computational Science, Nature Water, and Nature Cities, where my data visualizations have featured on the cover.",
        "My focus is on identifying context-specific problems and creating scalable, globally applicable solutions. Whether it's enhancing workplace productivity, understanding the impact of proximity on our environments, or fostering serendipity in walkable cities, my research aims to transform and improve urban life. While leading MIT's Senseable City Global Labs, I collaborate with partners worldwide, constantly seeking new challenges and innovative solutions in our evolving urban landscapes."
